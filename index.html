      "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet
      hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry,
      bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a
      hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. It had a perfectly round door like a
      porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact
      middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very
      comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled
      and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for
      hats and coats -- the hobbit was fond of visitors."
